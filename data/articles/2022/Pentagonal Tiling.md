Pentagonal Tiles

A few years back I read a newspaper article about the mathematical complexities around pentagonal tiling. Tiling itself can be already be approached as a mathematical problem field, of which pentagonal tiling appears to be a difficult sub genre. It is only since 2015 that scientists have proven that there are only 15 different tesselation layouts of pentagonal tiles that actually are "tileable".
The history of the discovery of all pentagonal tiling variations is a fascinating story. The first proofs were made in the beginning of the 20th century, in the 1970s, maths hobbyist xx discovered serveral new variations and only recently, with the aid of computers, Casey Mann discovered the 15th veriant. And that variant is one of a kind! The newspaper article from Dutch newspaper _the Volkskrant_ contained illustrations taken from the Pentagonal Tiling Wikipedia lemma and while reading that article, the 15th variant was visually the most remarkable for me.
I decided that if I would ever have a fitting opportunity to tesselate a wall with custom tiles, I would do my best to use the fifteenth variant. This idea stayed in my mind for years, until last year, when we decided to renovate the ground floor of our home.
