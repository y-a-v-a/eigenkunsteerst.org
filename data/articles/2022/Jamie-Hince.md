Somewhere in 2004 I felt the urge to discover new music. Not necessarily new as in ground breaking in technological sense, I just had the feeling there should be more people around who play and record the musical style and feel that I fancy.

My crave, keep in mind this was the pre-Spotify era, lead me to play records at record stores and seek the internet for MP3's of various bands. It left me with an unsatisfactory feeling.
I had always been fond of the darker melodic songs supported with groovy guitar riffs, like those of the Rolling Stones and the more anarchistic but gloomy Nirvana songs. At some time I discovered The White Stripes with their blues oriented and stripped down songs, supported by a minimal setup of voice, drums and guitar. I was intrigued by the way Jack and Meg were able to build a sonic landscape with minimal instruments, yet rocking it!
About the same time I ran into the Kills. I cannot recall precisely how I encountered their music but I was hooked. This was even more minimalistic than the White Stripes, raw and punky, very DIY yet melodic and with a female singer, Alison Mosshart, with a powerful voice.

But that guitar playing, that swampy groovy playing style, was something I was very attracted by. Jamie Hince combines riffs and rythm to compose dark undercurrents, supported by a simple drum computer, especially in the early days. He is able to shape beautiful darkness with his playing without using too many guitar pedals or other sound effect. It's all quite minimal yet warm and embracing.

bluesy and groovy
no power rock, but still the guitar as starting point

Best songs
Pale Blue Eyes, cover from The Velvet Underground, in the Kills version much darker.
Dead Road 7, ridiculously simple lyrics, groovy guitar play over computer drums.
