Somewhere in 2004 I felt the urge to discover new music. Not necessarily new as in ground breaking in technological sense, I just had the feeling there should be more people around who play the musical style and record the mood that I fancy.

My crave, keep in mind this was the pre-Spotify era, lead me to play records at record stores and seek the internet for MP3's of various bands. It left me with an unsatisfactory feeling.
I had always been fond of the darker melodic songs supported with groovy guitar riffs, like songs from the **Sticky Fingers** or **Exile on Main Street** albums of _the Rolling Stones_ or any of the more anarchistic but gloomy _Nirvana_ songs. At some time I discovered _The White Stripes_ with their blues oriented and stripped down songs, supported by a minimal setup of voice, drums and guitar. I was intrigued by the way Jack and Meg were able to build a sonic landscape with minimal instruments, yet rocking it! I was lucky to see them live in Amsterdam in 2005.

About the same time I ran into _the Kills_. I cannot recall precisely how I encountered their music but I was hooked. This was even more minimalistic than _the White Stripes_: recorded in a very DIY way, raw and punky yet melodic due to the female singer, _Alison Mosshart_, who has a powerful poetic voice.

And then that guitar playing, that swampy groovy playing style, that was something I was very attracted by. _Jamie Hince_ combines riffs and rythm to compose dark undercurrents, supported by a simple drum computer, especially in the early days. He is able to shape beautiful darkness with his playing without using too many guitar pedals or other sound effect. It's all quite minimal yet warm and embracing.

Their cover of **Pale Blue Eyes**, originally from _The Velvet Underground_, released as side track on _the Kills_ single **The Last Goodbye**, is much darker than its original version and sounds like a duet between a guitar and a singer. They stay true to the original version though, but made it more edgy and less lively, adding a gloomy undertow.

Similarly I like the dead simple **Dead Road 7**, a song that reminds me of early raw blues recordings of _Robert Johnson_. Its lyrics are of great simplicity, but its power lays in the fact that _the Kills_ are able to create a great song from the ingredients.

bluesy and groovy
no power rock, but still the guitar as starting point

Best songs

Dead Road 7, ridiculously simple lyrics, groovy guitar play over computer drums.
