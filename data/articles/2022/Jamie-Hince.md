Jamie Hince

Somewhere in 2004 I felt the urge to discover new music. Not necessarily new as in ground breaking in technological sense, I just had the feeling there should be more people around who play and record the musical style and feel that I fancy.
My crave, keep in mind this was the pre-Spotify era, led me to play records at record stores and seek the internet for MP3's of various bands. It left me with an unsatisfactory feeling.
I had always been fond of the darker melodic songs supported with groovy guitar riffs of the Rolling Stones and the more anarchistic but gloomy Nirvana songs. At the time I had discovered The White Stripes with their blues oriented and stripped down songs, supported by a minimal setup of voice, drums and guitar. I was intrigued by the way Jack and Meg were able to build a sonic landscape with basic instruments.
One way or another I ran into the Kills. I cannot recall precisely how I encountered their music but I was hooked. I wasn't hooked
