description: New insights on the Malevich exibition in 1927 in Berlin
---

According to the [catalog](https://doi.org/10.11588/diglit.13152#0109) of the Grosse Berliner Kunstausstellung, published in 1927, Kasimir Malevich had his first exihibition in Western Europe with them. In the catalog, a nice comparison is made between Malevich and Piet Mondrian in which, though both develop from similar grounds, the difference is that Malevich is considered dynamic, contrary to Mondrian's "completely static conception of art".
I hoped to find an image of the exhibition on view in the catalog, but after browsing all pages online, I was unable to find one. That doesn't mean there's no traces of the exhibition. In several other catalogs and books one picture is shown of the paintings on display in Berlin.
In one catalog I made a photo with my phone of the supposed exhibition view and I noticed two things I had not seen before. As the images aside this article show, there are two remarkable things worth digging deeper into. My first finding is that most reprints of the exhibition view I encounter in books are a combination of two separate images, combined into one. One can see this at best when focussing on the two paintings hanging just right of the chair.
The bottom one presumably "Suprematist Composition", 1916, version 1920-1921, oil on canvas, 80.3 x 80.3 cm, Private collection (p. 110 from "Kazimir Malevich and the Russian Avant-Garde", 2013)
